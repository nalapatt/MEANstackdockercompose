# MEANstackdockercompose

This project deploys a mean stack by using docker compose

You need to first install nodejs, docker and docker compose before using docker-compose [refer to notes in nalapatt/devopsinaws/installnodejs and installdockerswarm to install these]

create two directories angular-app and express-server 
copy the package.json files into both of these directories

These will be used by the Dockerfile
